# Automatic-Signature-Stability-Analysis-and-Verification-using-Image-Processing

The main purpose of this research is, to provide most advanced methods for signature stability
analysis using machine learning techniques. Now a dayâ€™s signature verification is the key most
authentication methods followed across many financial and banking sectors. Many banks,
financial sectors, educational institutions are validating and authenticating the process across
their system using signature verification. The stability analysis over the signature have become
most important and major challenging for the authenticators in order to validate the genuine
and fake signatures. This project implements the signature verification using local features and
applying image processing techniques. This method will find the clues by extracting the
potential areas from the extract features are considered to verify the signature of the users
during registration and authentication should match up to 90 to 95%. In the second part of the
project a novel signature verification system is proposed in order to evaluate the publicly
available datasets. Applying classification techniques on the datasets using machine learning
algorithms and provide the results to compare the signatures which are genuine, forged and
signatures which are disguised. The results are compared with the existing methods and the
implementation proves that gives low error rate of 15% and based on all the participants. The
comparison of the signatures across distributed computing through parallel processing with
less computation costs are integrated through proposed methods and algorithms.
